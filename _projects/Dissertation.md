## MNIST with a Twist: Learning Rotations with VAEs

This project explores whether neural networks can learn the concept of "rotation" through a conditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on MNIST digit images.

### Project Overview

The conditional VAE was designed to:
- Encode MNIST digits into a latent space
- Learn rotation as a manipulable variable in this space
- Generate new rotated versions of input digits

### Technical Implementation

- **Architecture**: Conditional VAE with rotation encoding
- **Dataset**: Modified MNIST with rotated versions of digits
- **Training**: [Brief description of training process]
- **Evaluation**: [How you evaluated the model's performance]

### Results

[Describe the results of your experiments]

### Visualizations

[Mention that you'll add visualizations/examples of the rotated digits]

### Code and Implementation

[Brief description of the codebase and implementation details]
